# PyMTV

Python implementation of the MTV algorithm by [Mampey, Tatti, and Vreeken](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9021554/papers/Tell_me_what_i_need_to_know.pdf).

## Getting started
To get started with PyMTV using the command line run:

    ./main.py -h

To import PyMTV as a Python module

    from mtv import MTV
    dataset = [1,2,3]
    mtv = MTV(dataset)


## Settings

The settings.py file contains the default settings for MTV. 
Use ./main.py -h from the command line to get a description 
of the different settings.

PyMTV was written as a part of my [thesis](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9021554/papers/Finding_Interesting_Patterns_in_the_Microbiome.pdf) written at the IT univerity of Copenhagen.
